# Building and maintaining SWSS with Bazel

Component `BUILD.bazel` files own the C++ sources and dependencies. Normal Bazel
builds use those definitions directly. CI independently compares them with
Automake; there is no source-map generation step before a build.

## Build commands

Run from the repository root with Bazelisk, which selects Bazel 8.5.1 from
[.bazelversion](../../.bazelversion). The managed GCC toolchains target Debian
Trixie and execute on the same CPU they target. Linux x86-64 is the default;
use `--config=aarch64` on a native ARM64 host.

```sh
# Build all 29 production C++ programs.
bazel build --config=release //dist:cpp_binaries

# Build one program while developing.
bazel build --config=release //orchagent:orchagent

# Build all C++ programs on an ARM64 host.
bazel build --config=release --config=aarch64 //dist:cpp_binaries

# Build the Rust program.
bazel build --config=release //crates/countersyncd:countersyncd

# Build the runtime tar and its matching detached debug symbols.
bazel build --config=release //dist:swss_pkg //dist:swss_pkg.debug_symbols

# Print a built program's output path.
bazel cquery --config=release //orchagent:orchagent --output=files
```

Building SWSS from another workspace needs root-module toolchain registration
and dependency overrides. Use the [external module guide](../../bazel/external-module.md)
for the complete caller configuration and current pins.

## Make a routine build change

Keep the native Automake declaration and the owning component's `BUILD.bazel`
in sync. [cfgmgr/BUILD.bazel](../../cfgmgr/BUILD.bazel) shows several programs
sharing source and dependency lists; [neighsyncd/BUILD.bazel](../../neighsyncd/BUILD.bazel)
is a smaller example.

### Add or remove a source

Update the program's `srcs` in its component BUILD file and its Automake
`*_SOURCES` declaration. If several programs compile the same files, use a
named list like `CFGMGR_COMMON_SRCS`. Shared sources compile separately with
each program's options. Export a source from its owning package when another
component refers to it, for example `//lib:recorder.cpp`.

Headers must be declared through the component's header targets. Production
programs depend on `:production_headers` and the corresponding targets in other
components. These targets supply file inputs without adding compiler options.
Keep `local_include_directories` in native order, including duplicates; paths
are relative to the SWSS root and `.` means that root. The shared macro also
makes these paths work for external module callers.

### Add a dependency

Add its public label to the program's `deps`. Put labels shared by several
programs in a named list in [deps.bzl](deps.bzl); keep component-specific choices
visible in the owning BUILD file. If the module or Debian package is new,
declare its pinned input in [MODULE.bazel](../../MODULE.bazel) and update the
native dependency declaration as well. The [dependency interfaces](../../bazel/external-module.md#dependency-interfaces)
list the existing Common, SAI, sairedis and DASH entry points.

When the new dependency introduces a native include root or library name,
update its explicit mapping in
[native_build_contract.py](../../bazel/native_build_contract.py). CI rejects
unmapped native inputs and checks that the declared provider is reachable.

### Add a program

Declare a `swss_cc_binary` beside its sources with explicit `srcs`, `deps` and
`local_include_directories`, following another program in that component.
The shared [cc.bzl](cc.bzl) and [flags.bzl](flags.bzl) supply common compiler
settings and conditional ASAN/GCOV startup sources. Set any program-specific
`ndebug`, `asan` or `gcov_preload` behavior to match Automake.

Add the program to Automake's installed program list and to `CPP_BINARIES` in
[dist/BUILD.bazel](../../dist/BUILD.bazel). That list selects both the production
build aggregate and the runtime tar's executables. CI discovers the programs
through `//dist:cpp_binaries` and compares them with Automake's installed list.

### Check the change

Build the affected program, then run the formatter and validation helper tests:

```sh
bazel run //tools/bazel/buildifier:buildifier.check
python3 -m unittest discover -s bazel/tests -v
```

Submit necessary validation and CI updates with the build change. The
[CI guide](../../bazel/README.md) describes the native AMD64/ARM64 build checks,
how to reproduce them, and their limits. The full
[native contract reference](../../bazel/native-build-contract.md) is useful when
changing compiler settings, dependency mappings or the comparison itself.

## Build configurations

| Configuration | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--config=release` | Selects Bazel `opt` mode and adds SWSS `-Wdate-time` and `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`. The managed GCC toolchain supplies `-O2`, stack and architecture hardening, RELRO, immediate binding, and early `--as-needed`. |
| `--config=debug` | Selects Bazel `dbg` mode and SWSS debug definitions, with `-O0` and fortification disabled. |
| `--config=asan` | Enables the SWSS C++ AddressSanitizer flags and startup sources. |
| `--config=gcov` | Enables SWSS C++ coverage instrumentation and `-O0`. |

The managed toolchain's optimization and baseline hardening apply in every
mode; SWSS debug targets explicitly override optimization and fortification.
ASAN and GCOV can combine with `release`; both disable fortification for SWSS
targets, and GCOV's `-O0` overrides the toolchain's `-O2`. The shared GCOV preload
library retains its startup constructor with `--as-needed`. These flags do not
instrument Rust, matching the native build's separate Cargo invocation. The
normal-release CI contract does not validate DEBUG, ASAN or GCOV settings.

## Rust builds

`//crates/countersyncd:countersyncd` uses `rules_rs` 0.1.0 and Common's public
Rust library, `@sonic_swss_common//crates/swss-common:swss_common`. Common owns
the Rust sources, generated bindings and native-library linkage. Bazel and Cargo
select the same Common source revision while that revision is under review.

`rules_rs` reads the tracked Cargo inputs directly. SWSS maps the generated
Common repository to Common's public target and maps `serde` and `serde_core`
to Common's exported targets. SWSS's JSON serializer therefore recognizes the
Serde implementations on Common's string type because both use the same
compiled Serde library. The native CI jobs build `countersyncd`, run its version
command, test that JSON roundtrip and inspect the resolved dependency graph.

To add a third-party crate, update the Cargo manifest and lock;
`all_crate_deps` supplies the declared dependencies to
[crates/countersyncd/BUILD.bazel](../../crates/countersyncd/BUILD.bazel).
No preparation script or `Cargo.Bazel.lock` is needed. CI retains the Cargo
inputs, generated `MODULE.bazel.lock` and resolved Serde labels. External
callers must apply the same [Rust toolchain and root repository mappings](../../bazel/external-module.md#rust-callers).

## Runtime and debug packages

`//dist:swss_pkg` contains 29 C++ programs, `countersyncd`, two Python helpers,
32 Lua files and `netbouncer.json`, at the paths from Automake and
`debian/swss.install`. [dist/BUILD.bazel](../../dist/BUILD.bazel) declares the
program and data lists, including the three VS Lua names that install Mellanox
implementations. Keep these lists in sync when adding installed files.

`//dist:swss_pkg.debug_symbols` contains matching detached symbols under
`usr/lib/debug/.build-id`. Both tars are split from the same linked ELFs. The
shared rule retains C++ debug information without changing optimization mode;
Rust targets retain source-line information explicitly. Root aliases
`//:swss_pkg` and `//:swss_pkg.debug_symbols` select the same outputs. The runtime
target carries `DebugSymbolsInfo` so consuming OCI images can collect symbols.

The tar has no Debian control metadata, maintainer scripts or dependency
declarations. It contains the SWSS payload; the consuming image must provide
matching shared libraries. See the [package validation guide](../../bazel/README.md#runtime-and-debug-package-validation)
for installed-file, debug-symbol and runtime checks and their limits.

## Dependency resolution and caching

[MODULE.bazel](../../MODULE.bazel) pins module/source versions and hashes.
[.bazelrc](../../.bazelrc) uses the SONiC registry's maintained `main` endpoint
followed by BCR, and enables Common's YANG C++ sources and generated schema.
Keep the generated `MODULE.bazel.lock` out of Git; CI retains it with the
resolved module graph. The [external module guide](../../bazel/external-module.md)
explains the selected versions, required overrides and toolchain settings.

Bazel reuses unchanged local outputs automatically. For reuse across worktrees
or CI jobs on one host, set a disk cache in the ignored `.bazelrc.user` or CI:

```text
build --disk_cache=/absolute/path/to/bazel-disk-cache
```

A shared CI cache can use an existing Bazel remote-cache service. Configure its
endpoint and authentication in CI, for example:

```text
build --remote_cache=grpcs://cache.example.com
```

Cache service deployment is independent of these targets. See
[Bazel remote caching](https://bazel.build/remote/caching) for supported backends
and configuration.
